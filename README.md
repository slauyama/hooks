# Personal React Hooks

## Hooks

- useLocalStorage

## Installation

Setup `.npmrc` to read from proper registry. Auth Token needs to be set up in Github.

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=AUTH_TOKEN
@slauyama:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

After setting up properly should be able to `npm install`.

```
npm i @slauyama/hooks@latest
```

## Why

Wanted to create a personal collection of React Hooks I can use on various projects.

## But this hooks already exist...

Just wanted to publish something on my own.
